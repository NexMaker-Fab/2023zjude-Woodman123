## Laser Cutting Materials

Laser cutting is a versatile process used for cutting a wide range of materials, each offering different properties and
challenges.

1. **Woods**: Different types of woods like hardwood, softwood, plywood, MDF, veneer, paper, and cardboard are commonly
   used. Each type has unique properties affecting laser cutting, like density, resin content, and presence of glues​.

    - **Hardwoods** like cherry, walnut, and oak have high fiber density and produce more smoke.
    - **Softwoods** like balsa and pine have lower fiber density and produce less smoke.
    - **Engineered woods** like plywood and MDF are easier to process but can generate toxic fumes due to adhesives and
      chemicals.

2. **Plastics**: Acrylic is the most popular plastic for laser cutting due to its excellent cutting and engraving
   qualities and lack of harmful fumes. Other plastics, like fluoropolymers, Delrin, polycarbonate, Mylar, and
   polyimide, behave differently under a laser, with some producing harmful fumes or requiring specific laser settings.

    - **Acrylic** offers excellent cutting and engraving results without harmful fumes.

    - **Polycarbonate** and **ABS** can produce heavy smoke or toxic gases, making them less ideal for laser cutting.

3. **Metals**: Laser cutting metal requires high-powered lasers. Different metals like steel, aluminum, and others can
   be cut, but the process can produce fumes and requires specific types of lasers and settings​.

4. **Fabrics**: Fabrics like cotton, nylon, polyester, and silk can be laser cut. Synthetic fabrics produce sealed
   edges, while natural fabrics may have frayed edges requiring additional finishing​.

5. **Leather**: Both natural and synthetic leathers can be laser cut. However, synthetic leathers with vinyl content
   should be avoided due to toxic fume release.

6. **Glass**: Glass is challenging to laser cut due to its brittle nature and transparency. Special techniques, like
   covering with a damp paper towel, are used to minimize the risk of fractures​.

7. **Paper**: Laser cutting paper, including cardstock and corrugated cardboard, is relatively easy but can be prone to
   catching fire, resulting in charred edges​.

When it comes to materials that should be avoided in laser cutting, there are several key types due to their hazardous
nature:

1. **PVC and Vinyl**: Produces chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid fumes, harmful to both the operator and the
   equipment​.
2. **ABS Plastic**: Emits toxic cyanide gas and tends to melt​.
3. **Polycarbonate**: Prone to discoloration and catching fire​​.
4. **Polystyrene and Polypropylene Foam**: Catch fire easily and generally melt instead of cutting.
5. **HDPE**: Tends to melt and catch fire​.
6. **Coated Carbon Fiber**: Releases toxic gases when cut​.

## Laser Cutting Design Rules and Cuts

When designing for laser cutting, it's essential to consider the material properties, laser type, and the desired
outcome. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Power and Speed Settings**: These vary depending on the material and the laser cutter. You'll need to adjust these
   settings to achieve optimal cutting results. It's advisable to start with recommended settings and then test
   different speed, power, and frequency settings.
2. **Material Thickness**: The thickness of the material can impact the power and speed settings required for effective
   cutting.
3. **Kerf (Cut Width)**: The laser beam has a thickness (kerf), which should be accounted for in the design, especially
   for interlocking or assembly parts.
4. **Complexity of Design**: Highly intricate designs may require slower speeds or multiple passes, especially for
   thicker or harder materials.
5. **Heat Affected Zone (HAZ)**: This refers to the area of the material that may be thermally affected by the laser
   cutting process. It's crucial to manage HAZ to prevent material warping or structural changes.
6. **Ventilation and Safety**: Adequate ventilation is necessary, especially when cutting materials that might emit
   fumes or toxic gases.

Each material and laser cutter has its specificities, so it's important to refer to the manufacturer's guidelines and
conduct tests before proceeding with the final cut.

## Incision Experiment

This section involves evaluating the kerf, which represents the laser's diameter. It is evident that lasers possess
specific diameters, and we can assess them using four rectangles, each having a width of 10mm.

Subsequently, we activate the power, verify the operational status of the equipment, and establish a connection between
the ventilation device and the external environment. We acquire a 3mm acrylic plate for the cutting process.

Following the procedure, we determined the dimension to be 41.0mm. Therefore, the kerf is calculated as:

```
(41.0 - 40) / 4 = 0.25mm
```

### Obtain the finished product

We activate the power, verify the operational status of the equipment, and establish a connection between the
ventilation device and the external environment. We acquire a 3mm acrylic plate for the cutting process.

Then we connect the computer and laser cutting machine, add files and download them, and set them according to the
actual situation.
