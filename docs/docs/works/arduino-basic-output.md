# Arduino: Basic & Output

:::tip

Due to the requirements of our project, we have decided to use the **STM32** and **ESP32** minimal development boards
after intense internal discussions. This means that we are unable to use [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) for
simulation. Instead, we will provide more photos of physical objects.

We will be completing the Arduino **Basic** and **Arduino Output** related assignments here, for other Arduino assignments
see [Arduino - Input & IoT](./arduino-iot.md).

### Video

This is our demo video, we use the `STM32F103C8T6` development board to control the LED light and motor, and display
some
information on the OLED screen.

<div style={{
    display: "flex",

### Image

Since we don't use an Arduino, we can't provide [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) screenshots, so we've provided
some photos of the real thing.
