# Arduino: Basic & Output

:::tip

Due to the requirements of our project, we have decided to use the **STM32** and **ESP32** minimal development boards
after intense internal discussions. This means that we are unable to use [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) for
simulation. Instead, we will provide more photos of physical objects.

We will be completing the Arduino Basic and Arduino Output related assignments here, for other Arduino assignments see [Arduino - Input & IoT](./arduino-iot.md).
