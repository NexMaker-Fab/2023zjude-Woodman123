# Arduino: Input & IoT

:::tip

Due to the requirements of our project, we have decided to use the **STM32** and **ESP32-S** minimal development boards
after intense internal discussions. This means that we are unable to use [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) for
simulation. Instead, we will provide more photos of physical objects.
