# Arduino: Input & IoT

:::tip

Due to the requirements of our project, we have decided to use the **STM32** and **ESP32-S** minimal development boards
after intense internal discussions. This means that we are unable to use [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) for
simulation. Instead, we will provide more photos of physical objects.

### Video

This is our demo video, we use the `ESP32-S` development board to control the LED light, RGB light, and get indoor
environment information. Besides, we developed a **[web page](https://iot-demo.littleor.cn/)** to **remote control** the
LED light and RGB light, and get the indoor
environment information.

<div style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    width: "100%",
  }}>
    <ReactPlayer width="360px" height="480px"  controls url='https://cdn.littleor.cn/assert/202310251056606.mp4' />
</div>

### Image

Since we don't use an Arduino, we can't provide [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) screenshots, so we've provided
some photos of the real thing.
