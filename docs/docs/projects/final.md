In a world where distances often create barriers in emotional connectivity, Emotion Link emerges as a beacon of
innovation, illuminating the unspoken words of our hearts. This pioneering product in the realm of Internet of Things (
IoT) leverages the simplicity of lighting to convey complex emotions, connecting people beyond the confines of physical
spaces.

## The Concept

Emotion Link is an IoT-enabled ambient light, designed to transcend the boundaries of traditional communication. By
allowing User A to express emotions through a web interface on their smartphone, these feelings are then translated into
specific light patterns on User B's Emotion Link device. This interactive feature not only conveys emotions but also
invites User B to respond by simply tapping the lamp, creating a tangible sense of connection.

## A Spectrum of Emotions

Emotion Link is not just a lamp; it is a palette of feelings. With a variety of preset light colors, each hue
communicates a distinct emotion:

* Red: Symbolizing passion, energy, love, danger, and urgency. Red can increase heart rate and alertness, making it a
  common choice in environments requiring quick response.
* Blue: Reflecting calmness, trust, stability, and professionalism. Known for its relaxing properties, blue is
  frequently used in medical and financial sectors to convey trust and security.
* Green: Associated with nature, growth, tranquility, and health. Green is linked with restoration and calmness, aiding
  in stress and anxiety reduction.
* Yellow: Denoting happiness, vitality, creativity, and sunshine. A bright color that uplifts spirits, though excessive
  yellow may induce restlessness.
* Orange: Relating to energy, warmth, enthusiasm, and sociability. Orange stimulates positive emotions and fosters
  social interactions.
* Purple: Evoking luxury, mystery, creativity, and spirituality. Often connected with royalty and nobility, purple
  imparts a sense of elegance.

## Advanced Interaction through LLM

Taking interaction to the next level, Emotion Link integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for emotion recognition. A
simple shake of the lamp allows users to issue voice commands like “turn pink”. The device captures these commands
through its microphone, sending them to a server where the LLM interprets and returns the corresponding color to the
lamp. Furthermore, it supports emotional recognition; a user saying “I am tired” prompts the LLM to select a soothing
color to comfort them.
