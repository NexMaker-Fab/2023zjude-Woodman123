# Fragrance In Sight: AI Customized Perfume 

Fragrance In Sight is an interactive art installation project that aims to create personalized perfumes based on visual style recognition. This article provides an overview of the project's background, motivation, and technical architecture.

## Background

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision have opened up new possibilities for connecting different senses and experiences. The Fragrance In Sight project explores how AI algorithms can link visual information with olfactory cognition to generate individualized perfumes.

## Motivation

The project is motivated by the idea that smells elicit powerful memories and emotions. Linking scents to visual elements like clothing styles provides a novel way to express and share olfactory experiences. The goal is to construct richer, more holistic olfactory cognition's by combining vision, AI, and customized scents.

## Technical Architecture

At a high level, the system incorporates three main technical components:

- Computer vision module that analyzes clothing style from user photos
- AI model that matches clothing features to perfume notes
- Mechanical device that blends oils to produce personalized scents

By connecting these modules, the system can recognize a person's visual style and transform it into a tailored multisensory experience.

## Conclusion

Fragrance In Sight explores innovative applications of AI at the intersection of senses and cognition. By generating personalized perfumes from visual inputs, the project aims to create novel individualized experiences that link smell, sight, and technology.
